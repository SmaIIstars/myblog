# D3-force

**[D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) is a web standards-based JavaScript visualization library that uses SVG, Canvas and HTML for data visualization. In data visualization, we often use graph to express the information contained in data. They can convenient for us to clearly sort out the connections between various nodes and quickly extract useful information. Graphical layout algorithms can make the scattered information clear and conform to the corresponding aesthetic standards. (The information is mostly carried in the relationship of points and edges)**
